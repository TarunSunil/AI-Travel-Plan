TRAVEL PLANNER - MINIMUM PRICE DISPLAY FIX
=====================================

Date: September 17, 2025
Issue: Minimum price display was showing "Minimum Flight Price" instead of "Minimum Hotel Cost per night"
Status: RESOLVED

PROBLEM ANALYSIS:
-----------------
The `/get_min_prices` endpoint was correctly calculating minimum hotel prices, but there was inconsistency in how the data was being used in the frontend. The tooltip was incorrectly displaying "Minimum Flight Price" and looking for a property called "min_flight_price" which didn't exist in the API response.

ROOT CAUSE:
-----------
Property name inconsistency between backend and frontend. The backend was sending `min_hotel_price`, but frontend was looking for `min_flight_price`.

SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:
--------------------
1. UPDATED FRONTEND DISPLAY:
   - Changed tooltip to show "Minimum Hotel Cost per night" instead of "Minimum Flight Price"
   - Updated code to look for the correct property name `min_hotel_price`
   - Improved error message when no hotel price data is available

CHANGES MADE:
-------------
File: static/app.js
- Updated tooltip text from "Minimum Flight Price" to "Minimum Hotel Cost per night"
- Fixed property reference from min_flight_price to min_hotel_price
- Changed error message to be more specific about missing hotel price data

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
------------------
Before Fix:
```javascript
// Update tooltip with minimum hotel cost
if (data && data.min_flight_price) {
    budgetTooltip.textContent = `Minimum Flight Price: ${data.min_flight_price}`;
} else {
    budgetTooltip.textContent = 'No price data available for this route';
}
```

After Fix:
```javascript
// Update tooltip with minimum hotel cost
if (data && data.min_hotel_price) {
    budgetTooltip.textContent = `Minimum Hotel Cost per night: ${data.min_hotel_price}`;
} else {
    budgetTooltip.textContent = 'No hotel price data available for this destination';
}
```

IMPACT:
-------
- Users now see correct "Minimum Hotel Cost per night" information
- Tooltip displays the actual hotel price data from the API
- Error message is more specific and helpful
- Property naming is consistent throughout the application

The tooltip now correctly provides users with minimum hotel pricing information for their destination, helping them set appropriate budgets for their travel planning.

TRAVEL PLANNER - HOTEL SEARCH API FIX
=====================================

Date: September 13, 2025
Issue: Hotel search was failing with 400 Bad Request error
Status: RESOLVED

PROBLEM ANALYSIS:
-----------------
The Amadeus Hotel Search API v3 was returning 400 Bad Request errors because we were sending unsupported parameters:
- ratings: '3,4,5' (not supported in v3)
- amenities: 'WIFI,PARKING' (not supported in v3)  
- sort: 'PRICE' (not supported in v3)

ROOT CAUSE:
-----------
The Amadeus Hotel Search API v3 has a more restrictive parameter set compared to older versions. The unsupported parameters were causing the API to reject our requests.

SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:
--------------------
1. REMOVED UNSUPPORTED PARAMETERS:
   - Removed 'ratings', 'amenities', and 'sort' parameters from hotel search
   - Kept only essential parameters: cityCode, checkInDate, checkOutDate, adults, currency

2. ENHANCED ERROR HANDLING:
   - Added specific error messages for different HTTP status codes
   - Added rate limiting awareness (429 errors)
   - Improved logging for debugging

3. SECURITY IMPROVEMENTS:
   - Added input validation
   - Enhanced error handling without exposing sensitive information
   - Added rate limiting awareness for production readiness

CHANGES MADE:
-------------

File: amadeus_api.py
- Line ~110: Removed unsupported parameters from hotel search
- Line ~140: Enhanced error handling for hotel search
- Line ~95: Enhanced error handling for flight search  
- Added import for 'time' module for future rate limiting implementation

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
------------------
Before Fix:
```
params = {
    'cityCode': city_code,
    'checkInDate': check_in,
    'checkOutDate': check_out,
    'adults': adults,
    'currency': currency,
    'ratings': '3,4,5',      # UNSUPPORTED
    'amenities': 'WIFI,PARKING',  # UNSUPPORTED
    'sort': 'PRICE'          # UNSUPPORTED
}
```

After Fix:
```
params = {
    'cityCode': city_code,
    'checkInDate': check_in,
    'checkOutDate': check_out,
    'adults': adults,
    'currency': currency
}
```

## FIREBASE DOMAIN AUTHORIZATION FIX - September 23, 2025

### CRITICAL AUTHENTICATION ISSUE RESOLVED:
**Problem**: Firebase authentication failing with `auth/unauthorized-domain` errors
**Root Cause**: Firebase project needs localhost domains added to authorized domains list in Firebase Console
**Impact**: All authentication methods (email/password, Google, GitHub) failing with domain authorization errors

### ERROR ANALYSIS:
**Evidence from Logs**:
- `auth/unauthorized-domain` for Google and GitHub social login
- `auth/invalid-credential` for email/password (separate issue - user entering wrong credentials)
- `Password field not found: undefined` (togglePassword function called without parameter)

### SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:

**1. FIREBASE CONFIGURATION CORRECTED:**
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `templates/index.html`
  - `templates/login.html` 
  - `templates/signup.html`
- **Change Made**: Reverted authDomain back to production value "ai-tp-a98af.firebaseapp.com"
- **Reasoning**: Production authDomain works when localhost is added to authorized domains in Firebase Console

**2. FIREBASE CONSOLE CONFIGURATION REQUIRED:**
**CRITICAL STEP**: Add these domains to Firebase Console → Authentication → Settings → Authorized Domains:
- `localhost` (covers all ports for local development)
- `127.0.0.1` (alternative localhost IP)
- `localhost:8000` (specific port if needed)
- `localhost:5000` (alternative development port)

**3. PASSWORD TOGGLE FIX:**
- **File Modified**: `templates/login.html`
- **Change**: Fixed `onclick="togglePassword()"` to `onclick="togglePassword('password')"`
- **Issue**: Function was called without required fieldId parameter

### TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
**Before (Broken)**:
```javascript
authDomain: "localhost", // ❌ Doesn't work with Firebase Console setup
onclick="togglePassword()" // ❌ Missing required parameter
```

**After (Fixed)**:
```javascript
authDomain: "ai-tp-a98af.firebaseapp.com", // ✅ Production domain with authorized localhost
onclick="togglePassword('password')" // ✅ Correct parameter provided
```

### FIREBASE AUTHORIZATION PROCESS:
**How It Works**:
1. **AuthDomain**: Points to your Firebase project (`ai-tp-a98af.firebaseapp.com`)
2. **Authorized Domains**: List of domains allowed to use Firebase Auth (must include `localhost`)
3. **Local Development**: Firebase checks if current domain (`localhost:8000`) is in authorized list
4. **Social Auth**: Google/GitHub verify domain authorization before allowing popup authentication

### IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:
**User Must Complete This Step**:
1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com)
2. Select project "AI TP" (ai-tp-a98af)
3. Navigate to Authentication → Settings → Authorized Domains
4. Add: `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, `localhost:8000`
5. Save changes

### AUTHENTICATION FLOW RESTORATION:
- **Email/Password**: Works after user enters correct credentials
- **Google OAuth**: Will work after authorized domains are added
- **GitHub OAuth**: Will work after authorized domains are added
- **Password Toggle**: Now functional with correct parameter passing

### USER EXPERIENCE IMPROVEMENTS:
- **Clear Error Messages**: `auth/unauthorized-domain` clearly indicates domain authorization issue
- **Functional UI**: Password visibility toggle now works correctly
- **Development Workflow**: Localhost development fully supported after Firebase Console update

### DEPLOYMENT CONSIDERATIONS:
**For Production**:
- Current configuration ready for production deployment
- Add production domain to Firebase authorized domains
- Remove localhost domains from production Firebase settings

**Environment Management**:
- Development: Add localhost to authorized domains
- Production: Use only production domains
- Testing: Add test domains as needed

### IMPACT:
- **Configuration Fix**: Proper authDomain for Firebase project communication
- **Authorization Setup**: Clear instructions for Firebase Console configuration
- **UI Functionality**: Password toggle and form interactions working
- **Development Ready**: Local development fully supported after domain authorization

**Result**: Complete Firebase authentication configuration with clear steps for domain authorization. Authentication will work immediately after authorized domains are added to Firebase Console.

## LOGOUT BUTTON POSITION AND FUNCTIONALITY FIX - September 23, 2025

### ISSUES RESOLVED:
1.  **Incorrect Position**: The logout button was appearing on the top-left of the screen instead of the top-right.
2.  **Non-Functional Button**: Clicking the logout button did not sign the user out or redirect them to the login page.

### ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:
1.  **Positioning Error**: A typo in `static/css/style.css` set `right: 100rem;`, pushing the button far off the right side of the screen and causing it to appear on the left.
2.  **Functionality Error**: The JavaScript `addEventListener` for the logout button was nested inside a `DOMContentLoaded` event. This event was not firing reliably because the main script was already at the end of the `<body>`, causing the click handler to never be attached.

### SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:

**1. CSS POSITIONING FIX:**
- **File Modified**: `static/css/style.css`
- **Change**: Corrected the CSS for `#logoutBtn` from `right: 100rem;` to `right: 1rem;`.
- **Impact**: The button is now correctly positioned in the top-right corner of the viewport.

**2. JAVASCRIPT LOGIC FIX:**
- **File Modified**: `templates/index.html`
- **Change**: Removed the `DOMContentLoaded` wrapper around the logout button's `addEventListener`.
- **Logic**: The event listener is now attached directly within the `onAuthStateChanged` callback as soon as the user's authenticated state is confirmed, ensuring the button is always functional.

### TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
**CSS Fix (`style.css`):**
```css
#logoutBtn {
    position: fixed;
    top: 1rem;
    right: 1rem; /* Corrected from 100rem */
    /* ... other styles */
}
```

**JavaScript Fix (`index.html`):**
```javascript
onAuthStateChanged(auth, (user) => {
    if (user) {
        // Logic is no longer inside DOMContentLoaded
        const logoutBtn = document.getElementById('logoutBtn');
        if (logoutBtn) {
            logoutBtn.addEventListener('click', async () => {
                await auth.signOut();
            });
        }
    }
});
```

### IMPACT:
- **Correct Layout**: The logout button now appears exactly where intended, in the top-right corner.
- **Working Functionality**: Clicking the logout button now correctly signs the user out, and the `onAuthStateChanged` listener handles the redirect to the login page.
- **Improved Reliability**: The JavaScript logic is now more robust and not dependent on the timing of the `DOMContentLoaded` event.

**Result**: The logout button is now correctly positioned and fully functional, providing a reliable way for users to sign out.
