TRAVEL PLANNER - MINIMUM PRICE DISPLAY FIX
=====================================

Date: September 17, 2025
Issue: Minimum price display was showing "Minimum Flight Price" instead of "Minimum Hotel Cost per night"
Status: RESOLVED

PROBLEM ANALYSIS:
-----------------
The `/get_min_prices` endpoint was correctly calculating minimum hotel prices, but there was inconsistency in how the data was being used in the frontend. The tooltip was incorrectly displaying "Minimum Flight Price" and looking for a property called "min_flight_price" which didn't exist in the API response.

ROOT CAUSE:
-----------
Property name inconsistency between backend and frontend. The backend was sending `min_hotel_price`, but frontend was looking for `min_flight_price`.

SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:
--------------------
1. UPDATED FRONTEND DISPLAY:
   - Changed tooltip to show "Minimum Hotel Cost per night" instead of "Minimum Flight Price"
   - Updated code to look for the correct property name `min_hotel_price`
   - Improved error message when no hotel price data is available

CHANGES MADE:
-------------
File: static/app.js
- Updated tooltip text from "Minimum Flight Price" to "Minimum Hotel Cost per night"
- Fixed property reference from min_flight_price to min_hotel_price
- Changed error message to be more specific about missing hotel price data

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
------------------
Before Fix:
```javascript
// Update tooltip with minimum hotel cost
if (data && data.min_flight_price) {
    budgetTooltip.textContent = `Minimum Flight Price: ${data.min_flight_price}`;
} else {
    budgetTooltip.textContent = 'No price data available for this route';
}
```

After Fix:
```javascript
// Update tooltip with minimum hotel cost
if (data && data.min_hotel_price) {
    budgetTooltip.textContent = `Minimum Hotel Cost per night: ${data.min_hotel_price}`;
} else {
    budgetTooltip.textContent = 'No hotel price data available for this destination';
}
```

IMPACT:
-------
- Users now see correct "Minimum Hotel Cost per night" information
- Tooltip displays the actual hotel price data from the API
- Error message is more specific and helpful
- Property naming is consistent throughout the application

The tooltip now correctly provides users with minimum hotel pricing information for their destination, helping them set appropriate budgets for their travel planning.
