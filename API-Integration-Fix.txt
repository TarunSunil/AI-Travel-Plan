# TRAVEL PLANNER - API INTEGRATION FIX

Date: September 18, 2025
Issue: Error fetching flight and hotel results ("Error fetching results. Please try again.")
Status: RESOLVED

## PROBLEM ANALYSIS

When searching for flights and hotels, the application displayed error messages on both the flight and hotel results sections. The errors appeared in the UI as:

```
Error fetching results. Please try again.
```

The issue was not immediately visible in the frontend logs, suggesting it was a backend API integration problem.

## ROOT CAUSE

Upon investigation, I found that the `search_flights` function in `amadeus_api.py` was attempting to use an undefined `amadeus` object, likely from a Python SDK that was never imported or initialized:

```python
def search_flights(origin, destination, departure_date, adults=1, currency='USD'):
    try:
        response = amadeus.shopping.flight_offers_search.get(  # <-- amadeus object undefined
            originLocationCode=origin,
            destinationLocationCode=destination,
            ...
```

Additionally, the hotel search API was using incorrect parameters for the Amadeus API v3 endpoint, which requires either `hotelIds` or a different endpoint for city-based searches.

## SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED

1. **FIXED FLIGHT SEARCH API INTEGRATION**:
   - Replaced the undefined `amadeus` object with a direct REST API call using the `requests` library
   - Added proper authentication token retrieval
   - Improved error handling and logging
   - Fixed data structure mapping from the API response

2. **FIXED HOTEL SEARCH API INTEGRATION**:
   - Implemented the correct two-step process for Amadeus API v3:
     1. First get hotel IDs for a city using `/v1/reference-data/locations/hotels/by-city`
     2. Then get hotel offers using these IDs with `/v3/shopping/hotel-offers`
   - Added better error handling and logging

3. **IMPROVED ERROR HANDLING**:
   - Added detailed logging for API responses
   - Provided meaningful error messages
   - Added response validation

4. **ADDED API DEBUGGING CAPABILITIES**:
   - Created a separate test script (`direct_api_test.py`) for isolated API testing
   - Added debug output for API requests and responses
   - Implemented validation of API credentials and access tokens

## TECHNICAL DETAILS

### Flight Search API Fix
```python
def search_flights(origin, destination, departure_date, return_date=None, adults=1, travel_class='ECONOMY', currency='USD'):
    """Search flights using Amadeus API"""
    try:
        # Get Amadeus API access token
        token = get_access_token()
        if not token:
            raise Exception("Failed to get Amadeus API access token")
        
        url = f"{AMADEUS_BASE_URL}/v2/shopping/flight-offers"
        headers = {'Authorization': f'Bearer {token}'}
        
        params = {
            'originLocationCode': origin,
            'destinationLocationCode': destination,
            'departureDate': departure_date,
            'adults': adults,
            'currencyCode': currency,
            'max': 15
        }
        
        # Add optional parameters if provided
        if return_date:
            params['returnDate'] = return_date
        if travel_class:
            params['travelClass'] = travel_class
            
        response = requests.get(url, headers=headers, params=params)
        response.raise_for_status()
        data = response.json()
        
        # Process response and return formatted flight data
        ...
```

### Hotel Search API Fix
```python
def search_hotels(city_name, check_in, check_out, adults=1):
    """Search for hotels using Amadeus API"""
    try:
        token = get_access_token()
        if token:
            city_code = get_city_code(city_name, token)
            if city_code:
                # Step 1: Get hotel IDs for the city
                hotel_list_url = f"{AMADEUS_BASE_URL}/v1/reference-data/locations/hotels/by-city"
                params = {
                    'cityCode': city_code,
                    'radius': 50,
                    'radiusUnit': 'KM',
                    'hotelSource': 'ALL'
                }
                
                hotel_response = requests.get(hotel_list_url, headers={'Authorization': f'Bearer {token}'}, params=params)
                
                if hotel_response.status_code == 200:
                    hotel_data = hotel_response.json()
                    if 'data' in hotel_data and hotel_data['data']:
                        # Get hotel IDs
                        hotel_ids = [hotel.get('hotelId') for hotel in hotel_data['data'][:5]]
                        
                        # Step 2: Get offers for these hotels
                        offers_url = f"{AMADEUS_BASE_URL}/v3/shopping/hotel-offers"
                        params = {
                            'hotelIds': ','.join(hotel_ids),
                            'checkInDate': check_in,
                            'checkOutDate': check_out,
                            'adults': adults
                        }
                        
                        # Process response and return formatted hotel data
                        ...
```

## IMPACT

- Users can now successfully search for flights and hotels
- Flight search correctly displays available flights with times and prices
- Hotel search correctly shows accommodations within the selected destination
- API integration is more robust with better error handling
- Debug logging provides better visibility for future troubleshooting

## TESTING VALIDATION

- Verified API credentials and access token retrieval
- Successfully tested direct API calls to flight and hotel endpoints
- Confirmed proper data mapping from API responses to frontend format
- Validated error handling for edge cases

## NEXT STEPS

1. Consider implementing an API client library for better maintainability
2. Add caching for frequently searched routes to reduce API calls
3. Implement rate limiting awareness to prevent API quota issues
4. Enhance error messages shown to users with more specific guidance
5. Consider implementing a monitoring system for API health
